# Project Abstract
Butterflies are elegant creatures that magnify the beauty of our environment and help in pollination. They serve a greater purpose in this world but many are going endangered and some are even on the verge of extinction. So, it is crucial to identify these butterflies for the safety of our ecosystem. For that reason, we have decided to develop a machine-learning algorithm to help us easily identify these species. Our approach would involve multiple parts such as image enhancement, image segmentation, region analysis, and more computer vision and deep learning techniques. Our dataset includes over 800 images of 10 unique classes of butterflies. ([Data-Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species)) We want to train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the butterflies based on their features. Furthermore, it is possible to deploy cameras to recreate a butterfly object detection model like YOLO.
